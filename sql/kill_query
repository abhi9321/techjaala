PostgreSQL - How to find and kill a query?

Sometimes, we might need to find and kill the queries that cause lock.

Find all the processes that are running:

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

So you can identify the PID of the hanging/long running query you want to kill. Cancel the query with the help of below query.

SELECT pg_cancel_backend(PID);


If you want to kill the session directly, run this instead:

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(PID);
